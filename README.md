playground
==========

Digital playpen for prototyping and testing the next great idea and/or piece of tech.

To start playing with the examples in the playground, clone the repo, install node, npm and bower, then in the playground repo (directory) run the following:

```bash
$> npm install && bower update
$> gulp
...
;=> Server running at: http://localhost:8899
```

In your browser of choice, navigate to the [playground](http://localhost:8899/playground/index.html)

Let me know if something is broken or needs a serious rewrite.
