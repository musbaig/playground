playground
==========

Digital playpen for prototyping and testing the next great idea and/or piece of tech.

To start playing with the examples I'm working on, you'll need node, npm and bower installed, then run:

```bash
$> npm install
$> bower install
$> node index.js

;=> Server running at: http://localhost:8000
```

and navigate to [playground](http://localhost:8000/playground/index.html)

Let me know if something is broken or needs a serious rewrite.
